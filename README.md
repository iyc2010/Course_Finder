AI Tools Used:

I used Claude AI to generate the main portions of my code and to help debug any issues that arose during development.
Additionally, I used Perplexity AI to walk me through terminal commands for correctly uploading and managing my project on GitHub.

What I Asked the AI to Help With:

Generating the initial structure and logic for my program
Debugging syntax and runtime errors
Explaining certain programming concepts when I was unsure
Providing examples of best practices for code organization
Clarifying Git and GitHub terminal commands for version control

What I Learned from the AI-Generated Code:
I learned how to create code for a frontend for my project. This helped me understand the process behind building a frontend. I also learned how to prompt AI better to give more basic code that meets the requirements without overengineering.

Modifications I Made to AI Suggestions:

I had to make multiple modifications to the AI Suggestions as I went through the process of doing my code. The intiial idea I had did not work so the AI suggested using mock data as opposed to a Real API. I altered this and pivoted to a new idea.
